# Line Endings: Always Use LF

## Rule

**Always use LF (Unix-style) line endings (`\n`) when creating or editing files.**

## Context

- This is a macOS development environment
- The project uses `.editorconfig` with `end_of_line = lf`
- Git is configured with `core.autocrlf = input`
- All files should use LF line endings, never CRLF (`\r\n`)

## Requirements

When creating or editing files:
1. **Always use LF line endings** - Never use CRLF or CR
2. **Ensure files end with a newline** - Files should end with a single LF character
3. **Normalize existing files** - If editing a file that has CRLF, convert it to LF

## Implementation

- The `write` tool automatically uses LF on Unix/macOS systems
- The `search_replace` tool preserves existing line endings, so ensure source files use LF
- If you encounter CRLF in existing files, normalize them to LF

## Verification

After creating or editing files, the line endings should be LF. On macOS/Linux systems, this is the default behavior, but be explicit about it.
